Drupal content type
-------------------

You need to create at least one content type with an image field.
You can of course change this to your own needs.

Drupal Installation
-------------------
Enable the module, give yourself the 'administer drupapp' permission
and go to admin/config/media/drupapp where you need to configure
some options like image field etc.

Give roles the "upload images via app" so they can upload images.

Every request is logged into watchdog - good or bad.

Android
-------

The app is written on Android 2.3.3, SDK level 10.

After compiling, run the application and configure
the url, username and password. The path in the url
matches the Drupal path, eg http://example.com/mobile-post
