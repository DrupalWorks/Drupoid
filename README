Drupal content type
-------------------

You need to create at least one content type with an image field.
You can of course change this to your own needs.

Drupal Installation
-------------------
Enable the module, give yourself the 'administer drupoid' permission
and go to admin/config/media/drupoid where you need to configure
some options like image field etc.

Every request is logged into watchdog - good or bad.

Android
-------

The app is written against Android 2.3.3, SDK level 10.
After compiling, run the application and configure
the url, username and password. The path in the url
matches the Drupal path, eg http://example.com/drupoid
